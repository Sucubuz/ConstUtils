# ConstUtils
An addon for meteor client 1.21.5 that are made for constantiam

I am not paid to provide support, glhf


modules:

AutoOmean: drink omen bottle automatically

ConstAntiQueue: kick player when they are in Constantiam queue so auto reconnect work



InfiniteWeapons: stop weapons from using durability

LagNotifier: ported from some hack I forgot, work better then meteor built in in my experience.

Speed+: A speed hack that doesn't crap itself on bed or in bushes, edited from meteor built in vanilla speed module
